    <h2>Understanding Angular</h2>
    <p>Angular is a powerful framework for building dynamic, single-page web applications. It’s developed and maintained by Google, ensuring it has a strong foundation and continuous updates.</p>
  
    <h3>Key Concepts in Angular</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Components:</strong> Components are the building blocks of an Angular application. They encapsulate the HTML, CSS, and logic required for a part of the user interface.</li>
      <li><strong>Modules:</strong> Modules help organize an Angular application into cohesive blocks of functionality, making the code easier to manage and scale.</li>
      <li><strong>Services:</strong> Services are used to share data and functionality across different components in an Angular application. They follow the singleton pattern, ensuring a single instance is used throughout the app.</li>
      <li><strong>Directives:</strong> Directives are special markers in the DOM that tell Angular to do something with a DOM element, such as hiding or showing it, or applying a particular style or behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>Routing:</strong> Angular's powerful routing system allows developers to define paths and navigate between different views or components in a single-page application.</li>
      <li><strong>Dependency Injection:</strong> Angular uses Dependency Injection (DI) to provide components with their dependencies, ensuring that they are easy to test and maintain.</li>
    </ul>
